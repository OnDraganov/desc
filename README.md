# desc
DESC is a DErived Sheaf Calculator: a tool for working with (co)chains in derived categories of sheaves over finite posets. The supported operations include computing the minimal injective resolution of a constant sheaf and star/shriek pushforwards/pullbacks of injective (co)chains through monotonic maps.
